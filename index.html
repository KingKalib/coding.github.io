<h3>Origins</h3>
<p style="width: 75%;">Playstation was the brainchild of Ken Kutaragi, dubbed "The Father of the Playstation". The console's origins date back to 1988 where it was originally a joint project between Nintendo and Sony to create a CD-ROM for the Super Famicom. Although Nintendo denied the existence of the Sony deal as late as March 1991, Sony revealed a Super Famicom with a built-in CD-ROM drive, that incorporated Green Book technology or CD-i, called "Play Station" (also known as SNES-CD) at the Consumer Electronics Show in June 1991. However, a day after the announcement at CES, Nintendo announced that it would be breaking its partnership with Sony, opting to go with Philips instead but using the same technology. The deal was broken by Nintendo after they were unable to come to an agreement on how revenue would be split between the two companies. The breaking of the partnership infuriated Sony President Norio Ohga, who responded by appointing Kutaragi with the responsibility of developing the PlayStation project to rival Nintendo. Nintendo offered Sony a "non-gaming role" but was rejected by Kutaragi.

<h4>Playstation</h4>
<p style="width: 75%">The original PlayStation, released in Japan on December 3, 1994, was the first of the ubiquitous PlayStation series of console and hand-held game devices. It has included successor consoles and upgrades including the Net Yaroze (a special black PlayStation with tools and instructions to program PlayStation games and applications), "PS one" (a smaller version of the original) and the PocketStation (a handheld which enhances PlayStation games and also acts as a memory card). It was part of the fifth generation of video game consoles competing against the Sega Saturn and the Nintendo 64. By December 2003, the PlayStation and PS one had shipped a combined total of 102.49 million units, eventually becoming the first video game console to sell 120 million units.</p>
<p>Some popular games on the original PlayStation were: Metal Gear Solid, Final Fantasy, Tekken 3, Tomb Raider etc.</p>
<h4>Playstation 1</h4>
<p style="width: 75%">Released on July 7, 2000, concurrently with its successor the PlayStation 2, the PS one was a considerably smaller, redesigned version of the original PlayStation video game console. The PS one went on to outsell all other consoles, including its successor, throughout the remainder of the year. It featured two main changes from its predecessor, the first being a cosmetic change to the console and the second being the home menu's Graphical User Interface; a variation of the GUI previously used only on PAL consoles up to that point.</p>
<p>Some popular games on the PlayStation 1 were: Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2, Gran Turismo 2, Castlevania etc.</p>
<h4>Playstation 2</h4>
<p>Announced in 1999, the PlayStation 2 was the first PlayStation console to offer backwards compatibility for its predecessor's DualShock controller, as well as for its games. The PlayStation 2 is the best-selling video game console of all time, selling over 155 million units, with 150 million confirmed by Sony in 2011. More than 3,874 game titles have been released for the PS2 since launch, and more than 1.5 billion copies have been sold. Sony later manufactured several smaller, lighter revisions of the console known as Slimline models in 2004 and well on, and in 2006, announced and launched its successor, the PlayStation 3. It competed with Sega's Dreamcast, Microsoft's Xbox and Nintendo's GameCube.</p>
<p>Some popular games on the PlayStation 2 were: God of War, Rachet & Clank, Devil May Cry, Kingdom Hearts, Jak and Daxter, GTA San Andreas etc.</p>
<h4>Playstation 3</h4>
<p>The console was first officially announced at E3 2005, and was released at the end of 2006. It was the first console to use Blu-ray Disc as its primary storage medium. The console was the first PlayStation to integrate social gaming services, including being the first to introduce Sony's social gaming service, PlayStation Network, and its remote connectivity with PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita, being able to remote control the console from the devices. In September 2009, the Slim model of the PlayStation 3 was released. It no longer provided the hardware ability to run PS2 games. It was lighter and thinner than the original version, and featured a redesigned logo and marketing design, as well as a minor start-up change in software. A Super Slim variation was then released in late 2012, further refining and redesigning the console.</p>
<p>Some popular games on the PlayStation 3 were: Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2, GTA V, The Last of Us, Red Dead Redemption, Skyrim, Uncharted Collection, Black Ops 2 and many more.</p>
